# Project-1-Guess-How-Many-Are-In-The-Jar

This is Project 1 of the Java Web Dev Techdegree from Team Treehouse.  

This application is a simple guessing game.  The user inputs 1) an item to fill a jar with and 2) a maximum number of that item.  A random number between 1 and the user's maximum number is chosen and the user is prompted to guess the random number.  After each guess the user is told if their guess is too high, too low, or matches the random number.
